;;;;
;;;; A Bus Journey Simulator
;;;;
;;;; Author:  Joe Peterson
;;;;    URL:  gitlab.com/l3mu
;;;; License: GNU GPL v3
;;;;
;;;;   Usage: (journey stops seats)
;;;;          Note: seats must be even!
;;;;          (journey 10 30) is what I used.
;;;;
;;;; Description:
;;;;   This is a whimsical simulator of the way in which I saw that I and other
;;;;   passengers on buses take our seats. We follow a two-step process:
;;;;     1) If there are whole seats with no one in them, sit there.
;;;;     2) If there aren't, sit next to someone.
;;;;   And that's what I tried to simulate. It may be a general rule, or it
;;;;   might be a quirk of riding buses in just this city, but I thought it was
;;;;   a bit amusing.
;;;;   Note that no more than nine passengers get on the bus at any one stop in
;;;;   this simulation.
;;;;
;;;;   Tested in GNU CLISP 2.49.93+ running on Fedora 29 64-bit.
